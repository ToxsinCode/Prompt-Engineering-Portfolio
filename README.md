# Prompt-Engineering-Portfolio  

Currently only one example is available (Microsoft Copilot). I beg for your patience as I establish this portfolio slowly. Most of my robust, quality demonstrations aren't shareable due to formal project NDA's. I also humbly refuse to copy-paste/derive my portfolio from others. This is quite a new field, with very vague understandings of what recruiters would like to see. As a result, feel free to comment or discuss insiggt, questions advice, or simply personal experiences. This can be an opportunity for a conversation :D. any suggestion
